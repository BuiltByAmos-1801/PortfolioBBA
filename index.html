      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m <strong>Amos Anand</strong> — a self-taught Web Developer, Designer, and
        Freelancer currently based in Bangalore, India. My journey in tech started with a
        simple curiosity: “How do websites work?” That curiosity turned into passion, and
        passion into a career where I now help businesses and individuals bring their ideas
        to life on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in both <strong>frontend</strong> and <strong>backend</strong>
        development, meaning I can design and build complete, production-ready websites from
        scratch. My process starts with understanding client goals, followed by thoughtful
        planning, clean coding, and continuous iteration until the product exceeds
        expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, I’m deeply passionate about UI/UX design — I believe a website should
        not only function perfectly but also create an emotional connection with its users.
        I love working on projects that challenge me creatively and technically, and I’m
        constantly learning new tools to stay ahead of the curve in web development.

      </div>
      
      <div class="about-extra">
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring UI design trends, contributing to
          open-source, or sharing tutorials with the developer community. My goal is to
          inspire others to start building and to show how web development can be both fun
          and fulfilling.

      <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
      <p>
        I combine strong technical knowledge with creative thinking to build interactive
        and scalable digital experiences. Each skill below represents hours of learning,
        experimentation, and hands-on work — all contributing to my growth as a modern web
        developer.

          <h4>HTML5 & CSS3</h4>
          <p>
            The foundation of the web. I write clean, semantic HTML and modern CSS that
            brings designs to life. From flexbox to grid layouts, I ensure pixel-perfect
            implementation and responsiveness across all screen sizes. My CSS philosophy:
            minimal yet meaningful.

        <div class="skill-card glass-card">
          <h4>JavaScript (ES6+)</h4>
          <p>
            JavaScript adds life to the web, and it’s the language I breathe. I use ES6+
            features to write efficient, modular, and maintainable code. From dynamic UI
            components to async API handling, I make sure every feature performs smoothly.

          <h4>React.js</h4>
          <p>
            My go-to framework for building powerful, interactive frontends. I love the
            component-based architecture, hooks, and reusability it offers. I also focus on
            optimizing rendering, using state management libraries, and ensuring accessibility.

          <h4>Node.js & Express</h4>
          <p>
            For backend development, I rely on Node.js and Express to build fast,
            lightweight, and scalable APIs. Whether it’s handling routes, authentication,
            or integrating databases, I ensure the backend complements the frontend
            perfectly.

        <div class="skill-card glass-card">
          <h4>MongoDB & SQL</h4>
          <p>
            Data is the backbone of any app. I use MongoDB for flexibility and MySQL for
            structure — depending on the project’s needs. I design efficient schemas,
            handle CRUD operations, and ensure data security and speed.

        <div class="skill-card glass-card">
          <h4>UI/UX Design</h4>
          <p>
            Designing is storytelling. I use Figma and Adobe XD to create intuitive user
            flows, wireframes, and prototypes that translate business goals into delightful
            experiences. My design mantra: <strong>clarity, consistency, and empathy.</strong>

          something new, and that’s what makes this journey exciting.

        Every project I take on is a combination of strategy, creativity, and technology.
        My goal isn’t just to build websites — it’s to build experiences that engage,
        convert, and leave a lasting impression. Whether you’re a startup looking to
        establish your online presence or a business aiming to scale, I provide

            I craft responsive, pixel-perfect interfaces that adapt beautifully to every
            device. From HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals to frameworks like React,
            I ensure your website loads fast, performs flawlessly, and looks stunning on
            any screen. I also focus on web accessibility so that everyone can interact

          <p>
            A great website needs a strong backbone. Using Node.js and Express, I develop
            secure APIs and manage server-side logic that keeps data flowing efficiently.
            I pay close attention to scalability, security, and performance, ensuring
            every system can grow with your business without breaking a sweat.

            message. I focus on creating visual systems that make your brand recognizable
